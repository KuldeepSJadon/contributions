## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. This particular template is set to knit to HTML output for inclusion in the Open Plant Pathology blog.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Including Mathematical Equations

Including equations uses LaTeX notation. To include an equation, wrap it in,
`$$`, *e.g.* `$$y = ax + b$$` would display: $$y = ax + b$$. To display inline
use a single `$`, *e.g*, $y$.

Greek symbols are also supported using a "\" followed by the character spelled out.

$$y_i \backsim Normal(\mu_i, \sigma)$$

$$\mu_i = \alpha + \beta x_i$$

$$\sigma \backsim Uniform(0, 1)$$

$$\beta \backsim Normal(0, 10)$$

$$\alpha \backsim Normal(0, 10)$$
