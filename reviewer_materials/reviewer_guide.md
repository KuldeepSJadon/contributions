# Open Plant Pathology Content Reviewer Guide

Open Plant Pathology accepts content to be posted to the website,
<https://www.openplantpathology.org/> that provide examples of teaching
materials, reproducible research and other materials of interest to plant
pathologists. To help ensure the quality of these materials, we ask that they be
peer-reviewed by qualified members of the Open Plant Pathology community.

To review content, please begin by copying our
[reviewer template](reviewer_template.md), pasting it in your reply to the issue
thread on GitHub and using it as a high-level checklist. We ask you provide
general comments addressing the following:

- Does the content clearly state the objectives?
- Does the content meet those objectives?
- Is the content clearly written and understandable for a general audience?
- Are there improvements that could be made to the code style?
  - Is the code clear and easy to understand?
  - Is there code duplication in the content that should be reduced?
  - Are the R packages used the best tools for the job or can you suggest others
  that may be more suitable?

Please be respectful and kind to the authors in your reviews. Our
[code of conduct](https://github.com/openplantpathology/contributions/blob/master/.github/conduct.md)
is mandatory for everyone involved in the review process.

## Submitting the Review

- When your review is complete, paste it as a comment into the content
contribution issue that you are reviewing.
- Please strive to complete your review within three weeks of accepting a review
request. We will aim to remind reviewers of upcoming and past due dates.
We may assign additional or alternate reviewers if a review is excessively
late.
- Additional comments are welcome in the same issue as a content submission
request. We hope that content reviews will work as an ongoing conversation with
the authors as opposed to a single round of reviews typical of manuscripts.
- You may also submit issues or pull requests directly to the package repo if
you choose, but if you do, please link to them in the contribution repo issue
comment thread so we have a centralized record of your review.
- Please include an estimate of how many hours you spent on your review at the
end of your review.

## Review follow-up

Authors should respond to the review within two weeks with their changes to the
package in response to your review.  At this stage, we ask that you respond as
to whether the change sufficiently address any issues raised in your review. We
encourage ongoing discussion between package authors and reviewers, and you may
ask us to clarify issues in the review thread, as well.
