## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for
authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown
see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. This particular template is set to knit to
HTML output for inclusion in the Open Plant Pathology blog.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes
both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the
document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Spelling

Please ensure that you have made sufficient efforts to ensure that you have used
proper spelling. Using RStudio, spell check is available in the tool bar, the
"ABC âœ“" button to the right of the "Save" icon.

## Code Formatting

- Inline code can be specified using a single "`" to enclose the code, e.g.,
`summary(cars)`

- Package names should be bold code, e.g. **`ggplot2`**

- Functions should be referred to using "()" after, e.g. `ggplot()`

- Function parameters should be referred to as in-line code where necessary,
e.g., `aes`.

- Using RStudio highlight code chunks and use "Code > Reindent Lines" to help
ensure consistent code indenting.

- Follow a consistent code style when writing code, several are available, pick
one and follow it through the entire post, here are two if you are unfamiliar:
  
  - <http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html>
  
  - <https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml>
  
- Keep line lengths to <80 characters if at all possible to keep readability

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent
printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Including Mathematical Equations

Including equations uses LaTeX notation. To include an equation, wrap it in,
`$$`, *e.g.* `$$y = ax + b$$` would display: $$y = ax + b$$. To display in-line
use a single `$`, *e.g*, $y$.

Greek symbols are also supported using a "\" followed by the character spelled
out.

$$y_i \backsim Normal(\mu_i, \sigma)$$

$$\mu_i = \alpha + \beta x_i$$

$$\sigma \backsim Uniform(0, 1)$$

$$\beta \backsim Normal(0, 10)$$

$$\alpha \backsim Normal(0, 10)$$

# Reproducibility

This section will automatically list your R session information.

```{r reproducibility, echo=FALSE}
devtools::session_info()
```

# References

Any references found in the [bibliography.bib](bibliography.bib) file will
automatically be listed in this section.
